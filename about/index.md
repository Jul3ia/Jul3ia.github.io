This is how you make **bold print**, [**bold links**](https://www.instagram.com/jul3ia/) and [normal links](https://www.instagram.com/jul3ia/).

## This is how you make a header:

* This is how you make a bullet point
* This is how you reference an [internal URL]({{ site.url }}/404.html).
* This is how you link to an [external URL](https://www.instagram.com/jul3ia/)

<a markdown="0" href="{{ site.url }}/theme-setup" class="btn">How to Make a Button</a>

[^1]: Example: *domain.com/category-name/post-title*
