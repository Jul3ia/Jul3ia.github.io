In the decade prior to working in iOS development, she had a career in television, where was most known for her two Emmy-Award winning videos, [**OMG LOL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5owbC2kB4YI&t=4s) and [**Reality TV**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K142AW4IQ), as well as other [award-winning videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEKiKsqZgKxJNvaSn8SulSYRQgRiqFRc3). She began her journey with code in 2011 while living on the garden isle of Kaua'i, Hawai'i, thanks to a growing curiosity about software development combined with the modern wonder of _the internet_. She has been a total code addict ever since, and constantly seeks to improve her craft.
